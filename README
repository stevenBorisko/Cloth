Simple cloth mesh simulator using springs. This is a work in progress,
	so there are, inevitably, many things wrong

The drawing of each object uses OpenGL. If you want to change that,
	that will be in each Displayable's `draw` function

- - - - Setup - - - -

- - Using the sample driver given in SampleDriver/

Sample driver setup:
	Copy main.cpp and Makefile from SampleDriver/ to one level higher than Cloth/
		Meaning Cloth/, main.cpp, and Makefile will be in the same directory
		at the same level

Using the sample Makefile to compile:
- Before compilation, you MUST execute `make ObjectDirectory`
- Compile: `make`
- Compile and run: `make test`
- Clean: `make clean`

- - Using your own Makefile

Makefile setup:
- Include Cloth's makefile with
	include Cloth/Cloth.mk
- Add as a prerequisite for your executable target
	$(CLOTH_MAIN_OBJ)
- Add as a prerequisite for your clean target
	ClothClean
- Call `make ClothObjectDirectory` before compiling

Particle: ParticleBinding.hpp
	Has zero to many bindings

Binding: ParticleBinding.hpp
	Has exactly two particles

Scene: Scene.hpp
	Stores all of the data in the environment
		- All the Bindings
		- All the Particles
		- Global settings like gravity

Physics: Physics.hpp
	Updates particle positions, velocities, and forces
	Houses constants like THREAD_COUNT and TIME_STEP

Input: Input.hpp
	Generates a scene

Noteworthy header files within Cloth:
	src/DataStructures/ParticleBinding/ParticleBinding.hpp
	src/DataStructures/Scene/Scene.hpp
	src/Input/Input.hpp
	src/Physics/Physics.hpp

- - - - How it works - - - -

A Binding connects two Particles.
	It sort of acts like a spring that has no mass but has a point mass
		(Particle) at each end of it.
	Neither of these should be manipulated without extreme caution with respect
		to thread safety.
